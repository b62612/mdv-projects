    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p>I have chosen My Project 3 theme in other to expand on my project 2 concept to fit into a real life situation in soccer sports management.</p>
<p>The theme is based on the idea that in a soccer team of about 30 players, there are even more players owned by the club that are either relegated to play for the second tier team or are considered surplus. Some of these players usually attract interests from other soccer clubs.</p>
<p>To explore on  this reality that soccer clubs face I have chosen to script for a situation where clubs may decide to offload players considered surplus to requirement.</p>
